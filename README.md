# Project Brief:
Title: Guardians' Playlist Generator
Objective: To create personalized playlists for each Guardian of the Galaxy based on their preferred music genre.
Technologies Used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

# What I Included:
Expanded the songs array with at least five songs, each including title, artist, and genre.
Assigned preferences to each Guardian by completing the guardians object.
Implemented the generatePlaylist function using the map() function to create personalized playlists for each Guardian.
Dynamically created and appended elements to the #playlists div to display each Guardian's playlist, including their name and list of songs.

# Challenges:
Expanding the songs array with diverse songs that cover various genres.
Assigning appropriate music genres to each Guardian based on their character traits or preferences.
Implementing the generatePlaylist function correctly to filter songs by genre for each Guardian.
Dynamically creating and styling elements in HTML/CSS to display the playlists effectively.

# Areas of Improvement:
Enhance user interface with more interactive features such as play buttons for each song.
Implement sorting or search functionality within playlists.
Utilize external APIs to fetch real song data instead of hardcoded values.
Add error handling for cases where songs of a specific genre are not available.

# Overall Learning:
Strengthened understanding of JavaScript arrays, objects, and higher-order functions like map().
Improved skills in DOM manipulation for dynamically generating HTML elements.
Learned to tailor solutions to specific requirements and user needs.
